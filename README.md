# Prefix-Calculator-Haskell
Haskell Prefix calculator
Haskell Code File - project14337.hs

-Purpose of this file is the source code to run the prefix expression program


Read me file - README.txt

- Purpose of this file is the list and description of each file in the archive and instructions on how to compile the source code

Write Up - Write Up.pdf


-Purpose of this file is to answer the following questions: 
– How did you approach the project?
– How did you organize the project? Why?
– What problems did you encounter?
– How did you fix them?
– What did you learn doing this project?
– If you did not complete some feature of the project, why not?
∗ What unsolvable problems did you encounter?
∗ How did you try to solve the problems?
∗ Where do you think the solution might lay?
· What would you do to try and solve the problem if you had more time?

-This will explain my thought process, organization, problems and solutions. 

TO COMPILE THIS PROJECT: 
Use a compiler that will compile the Haskell language. I was using an online compiler called "Online GDB, https://www.onlinegdb.com/" tp write and test my code. Make sure to select haskell as the language in the top right corner under "Languages." Using my "project14337.hs" file, compile the code in the editor. You can copy and paste my code as it is just 1 file or upload the source code to compile it. To run the compiled code, press the green "Run" button on the top left and the program will begin. My project does not depend on any extrenal libraries or modules and should run as soon as you press the run button. To exit the program, enter "exit."

I HAVE NOT RUN MY CODE IN THE TERMINAL, but if you would like to compile on there I believe that the steps are:

Navigate to the directory in which the project14337.hs file is in.

Compile the code and create an output file

ghc -o OutputFile project14337.hs

Replace the OutputFile with the desired name to create the executable. (They have to be in your directory.

Lastly run the executable

./OutputFile

Example of a test run:
